        <p>Hi everyone. Parinita here. My hands are literally shaking as I post this. I am a recent grad, and to be honest, adulting is hard. I’ve been applying for jobs, but I can’t help but miss being a kid. </p>      
        <p>I have been reading since as long as I can remember. It started with books from Disney princess stories to classics like Lord of the Rings. Never got into non-fiction though, they can be real snooze fests.</p>
        <p>I have always been inspired by writers.  I think it's completely amazing how they create a different world by their imagination– J.K. Rowling, Cassandra Clare. I think I can be a good writer. I have been applying for jobs as a technical content writer. </p>
        <p>I wrote 2 books - or tried to - one was a murder mystery and another was an apocalyptic world with zombies. </p>
        <p>Writing at times is easy to me, but the publishing part makes me nervous. Letting people read what you write is like handing them a piece of yourself — and people can be judgmental. They may not always like what you write, they may not agree with you. But that’s ok. It’s part of the process. </p>
        <p>I like to think people have much better things to do than think about what I write. It gives me a sense of peace. It’s ok to not be perfect, all that matters is to start somewhere. </p>
        <p>I think of myself as my own audience. If I like it, someone else out there probably will too. Maybe even more people.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure which direction this blog will go. There are so many things I like, so many new things to learn. Hopefully I’ll get the hang of it and I’ll keep getting better. So stay tuned. </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading. </p>
