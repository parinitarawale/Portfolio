      <h3 style="text-align: center;" >#2 What Nobody Tells You About Job Hunting After Graduation</h3>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >Graduation Highs & Real-World Lows </h4>
        <p>Hi, I’m Parinita — a recent IT graduate with a passion for writing and web development.  First of all, congratulations to all of my batchmates. While I’m proud we graduated, I quickly realized that job hunting is a different kind of challenge.</p>      
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >The LinkedIn Pressure Cooker</h4>
        <p>You must have used LinkedIn. The app is truly overwhelming. To be honest, I have turned off my notifications for this app. Every single notification used to be about someone completing a project or bagging an internship or a job. Good for them, though. The pressure to “succeed” is immense and the self-doubts keep increasing. But that’s OK.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >Degrees Aren’t Enough Anymore</h4> 
        <p>I have been applying to jobs, just like everyone does. You get your degree and you apply for jobs. But I guess they skipped the skills development part. The degree isn’t enough, you need skills too. My specialization is Full Stack Web Development. In college, we covered the basics — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java — but most job descriptions now expect knowledge of tools like React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, which I did start learning, but it doesn't seem as easy. College gave me the basics — the rest, I’m learning the hard way. I’m currently figuring out how to balance DSA and development — if you’ve been there, let’s talk.</p>
       <h4 style="text-align: center;" >Rejections: A Daily Reality </h4>
        <p>So now I'm making an account on every single MNC’s website to apply for jobs, only to receive the familiar rejection message. I get rejection emails daily. 
          <p>“We regret to inform you that ” or “we’ve decided not to proceed with your candidacy”</p>
         <p>It hurt the first time, but now I'm just used to it. But I'm grateful for them. At least it's better than the companies that leave you hanging high and dry. </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >Staying Resilient and Moving Forward </h4>
         <p>Right now, I’m focused on improving my skills and staying consistent. I’m currently reading Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 24 Hours by Arie Jones, Ronald R. Plew, and Ryan K. Stephens to brush up on the basics. If you’re in the same boat — hang in there. We’ve got this. Anyone else navigating the same path? Let’s connect! Feel free to reach out if you want to share tips, resources, or just need a cheerleader. Let’s support each other on this journey!</p>
